Project Title: Corporate Event Management System

Description:
The Corporate Event Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline event planning and attendance tracking within a company. This web-based application is built using React and utilizes MongoDB as its database.

Key Features:

1. **Admin Role:** Administrators have the authority to create and manage corporate events. They can easily select and invite employees from a list of company personnel.

2. **User Role:** Employees have access to the application as regular users. They receive event invitations via email and have the option to accept or decline these invitations directly from their email notifications.

3. **Event Calendar:** The application boasts an intuitive event calendar where employees can view upcoming events they are invited to. This calendar serves as a central hub for tracking and managing their participation.

4. **Email Integration:** Event invitations are seamlessly delivered to employees' email inboxes. Users can conveniently respond to invitations by simply clicking on the provided links in their emails.

5. **Real-time Updates:** The system provides real-time updates to both administrators and users. As soon as an employee responds to an invitation, the event status is updated accordingly.

6. **Event Details:** Employees can access detailed event information, including date, time, location, agenda, and any additional notes provided by administrators.

Benefits:

- **Efficient Event Planning:** The system simplifies event planning for administrators by automating the invitation process and providing real-time feedback.

- **Convenient User Experience:** Employees benefit from a user-friendly interface, email notifications, and an easily accessible event calendar, enhancing their overall experience.

- **Enhanced Communication:** The application fosters seamless communication between administrators and employees, ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding upcoming events.

- **Time and Resource Savings:** By automating event management, the system saves time and resources that can be allocated to other critical tasks.

The Corporate Event Management System in React and MongoDB serves as an invaluable tool for modern companies, promoting efficient event coordination and employee engagement.
